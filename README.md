# GeneticArch_ID_Deer

This repo contains all Rscripts used in the paper Hewett, A. M., Johnston, S. E., Morris, A., Morris, S., & Pemberton, J. M. (2024). Genetic architecture of inbreeding depression may explain its persistence in a population of wild red deer. Molecular Ecology, e17335. Please cite this work if you use any scripts or data. Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions!

Workflow is categorised per trait: Birth weight, juvenile survival, lifetime breading success (LBS) males and females. 
Each trait contains 4 Rscripts:
1) Creating the dataframe from database info and ROH search.
2) Running multi-membership model.
3) Creating model predictions and plotting figures.
4) Supplementary figure of variance explained by FROH per chromosome correlated with chromosome length.

Dataframes produced from step 1 can be found at: https://figshare.com/projects/GeneticArch_ID_Deer/193382
Note: these dataframes have Ids anonymised (This means that now e.g. Code = Code_anon etc) for data accessability.
The pedigree is also provided, again with anonymised Ids.
