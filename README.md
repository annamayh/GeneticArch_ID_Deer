# GeneticArch_ID_Deer

This repo contains all Rscripts used in the paper titled "Genetic architecture of inbreeding depression may explain its persistence in a population of wild red deer". Hewett et al. 

Workflow is categorised per trait: Birth weight, juvenile survival, lifetime breading success (LBS) males and females. 
Each trait contains 3 Rscripts:
1) Creating the dataframe from database info and ROH search
2) Running multi-membership model
3) Creating model predictions and plotting figures.

Folders also contain dataframes created from Rscript step 1, with Ids anonymised (This means that now e.g. Code = Code_anon etc) for data accessability.
The pedigree is also provided, again with anonymised Ids.
